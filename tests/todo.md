make API a new format

-> change rows to be independent (can have different metrics per row)
-> better handling of image data
-> better construction of widgets/layout

-> only make update button when graph avg chosen

later
-> pass a generator to loop over the dataset
-> can link image labels from dataset into metrics
-> show next arrows when generator used
