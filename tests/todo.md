make API a new format


========
make class that has specific calls:
  - (maybe put on the UI class) how to display images (e.g. what colour space)


 - get UI class to make UI items based on what the image data class returns

example of independent row metrics

====

later
-> pass a generator to loop over the dataset
  - need to have __len__ and __call__ properties
-> can link image labels from dataset into metrics
-> show next arrows when generator used






docs:

transforms run top to bottom of the sliders

**images are resized before showing as an image widget

know issues:
   sliders on wayland display server as less responsive
