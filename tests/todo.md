### good to knows:
transforms run top to bottom of the sliders

**images are resized before showing as an image widget

know issues:
   sliders on wayland display server as less responsive


============
TO DEV:
----------
option for re calculation of metrics avg graph/range plots for current slider values
(avg graph current button ----> change to menu drop down?)

option to resize image to a given size after transformations (good if trans affects the size of the image e.g. box crop)

have transforms that take 2 or more params/sliders
