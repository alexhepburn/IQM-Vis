Needs doing:
  - add NLPD
  - add support for inputting human experiment results

  - load human experiment data in the visualise tab

UI
  - Export images
    - ref
    - all distortions
    -  graphs
  - Tool bar
     - luminance calibration
  - Separate metric range plots based on window_name (same range_worker thought?)
  - save to the class an attr which window tab currently on so 
    no need to pass around window_name so much



Experiment:
  -

  - expose num_steps to experimetnal setup in plot_utils.get_all_slider_values
  - store results - good naming structre for images/QLabels
  - save results
  - timer
  -

minor:
  - install package correct docs

  - fix metric images being stretched (muliptle rows)
  - Option to change screen calibration
  - move redo graphs menu to separete menu tab

  - get metrics and metric images from all data stores



CODE styling
  - make the whole self.window_names setup more polished
  - make a base class for QMainWindow for each window with set style, close event etc.
  - make a deepcopy of datastore for experiments
