Needs doing:
  - post processing on images (after transforms - e.g. zoom after for both ref and trans)
    - this will allow for better rotation and translation


UI
  - Export images
  - Tool bar
     - image display size
     - calibration


minor:
  - fix metric images being stretched (muliptle rows)
  - only calc range plots when arrow pressed
  - Option to change image display size
  - Option to change screen calibration
