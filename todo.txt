Needs doing:
  - add NLPD
  - add support for inputting human experiment results
  - add SCATTER plot of correlations
    - interactive to get which images fail the correlation

UI
  - Export images
    - ref
    - all distortions
    -  graphs
  - Tool bar
     - luminance calibration
  - Separate metric range plots based on window_name (same range_worker thought?)


Experiments:
  - sort all images RMSE
  - expose num_steps to experimetnal setup in plot_utils.get_all_slider_values
  - sorting algorithm
  - store results - good naming structre for images/QLabels
  - save results
  - timer

minor:
  - fix metric images being stretched (muliptle rows)
  - Option to change screen calibration
  - move redo graphs menu to separete menu tab

  - get metrics and metric images from all data stores



CODE styling
  - make the whole self.window_names setup more polished
  - make a base class for QMainWindow for each window with set style, close event etc.
  - make a deepcopy of datastore for experiments
